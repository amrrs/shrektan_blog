> In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few. ^[ShunryÅ« & Dixon Suzuki. _"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"_]

- I've learned [actuarial science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science) for almost 7 years and I am working in financial industry as a quant.
- My father bought me a computer when I was 10 years old (around 2000) and I felt love in it immediately. However, I had to learn everything by myself because there's simply no people knows much about computers at that time in my hometown. I have developped a good intuition about how computers work but I didn't realize my passion on programming until my first internship as an assitant acturay in a life insurance company.
- R is my favouite language but occationally I need C++ as the core calculating engine to boost the performance. Excel and VBA is also on my skill set because they're quite handy and used widely in the office. I had some experience on VB.NET but no a big fan of it.
- I do believe in a Zen's mind and try my best to learn every day.
